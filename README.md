# Frontend Mentor - FAQ accordion card

Frontend Mentor challenge, coded by YohanR19.

Notes: Took me 4 hours to complete this one. I learned a couple 
of new techniques, so i expect new proyects to be more smooth.

*I had trouble at first to get a proper responsive desing.
The tool that helped me overcome that challenge
was always present, i used the Responsive Desing Feature
in Mozilla Developer Tools, (you can enter whit Crt+shift+M)
after using the Responsive Desing Feature it was a breeze to
manage the desing to look good in any device.
